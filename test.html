        <li><strong>Example:</strong> The robot updates its estimate of the value of taking a specific action from its current position based on the reward received and the estimated value of future actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> Uses the maximum reward of the next state for learning, regardless of the policy being followed.</li>
    </ul>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Actor-Critic Methods</h3>
    <p>Combines value function (critic) with policy (actor):</p>

        <li><strong>Actor update:</strong> ∇θJ(θ) = ∇θ log πθ(a|s)A(s, a)</li>
        <li><strong>Advantage function:</strong> A(s, a) = Q(s, a) − V(s)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Handles large state spaces where traditional Q-learning is infeasible.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience Replay:</strong> Stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> The robot saves its experiences of hitting walls and reaching goals to learn more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Network:</strong> Uses a separate network to compute the target Q-values, reducing oscillations and divergence.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> The robot uses a separate target network to stabilize learning, updating it less frequently.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Rule:</strong> Loss = (r + γ max<sub>a'</sub> Q'(s', a') − Q(s, a))^2</li>
        <li><strong>Target Q-network:</strong> Q' is the target Q-network.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dueling DQN:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Splits the Q-network into two streams: one for state value and one for advantage function.</li>
                <li>Q(s, a) = V(s) + A(s, a)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The agent aims to maximize the sum of discounted rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> G<sub>t</sub> = ∑<sub>k=0</sub>^∞ γ^k r<sub>t+k+1</sub></li>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Policy Improvement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Policies are improved iteratively by evaluating and updating them to increase the expected return.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A robot updates its policy to choose actions that lead to higher rewards based on its experience in the maze.</li>
